# dct: Decentralized Construct Taxonomies

In psychology, many different guidelines exist for
developing measurement instruments and manipulations of constructs.
When conducting empirical research or secondary research,
therefore, it is important to have a clear idea, and clearly
communicate, which guidelines are followed. However, these guidelines
are fragmented, and no universal consensus exists regarding how any
construct must be measured or manipulated. Therefore, developing one
'final' taxonomy is not feasible or even desirable. At the same time,
it is important that people clearly communicate their 'study-specific
taxonomy'. The `dct` package makes it possible to combine these two
goals.
